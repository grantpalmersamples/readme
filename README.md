# Hello,

This account contains public samples of my work intended for viewing by employers.

Currently I've posted one project, property wrapper, as a brief demonstration of my coding and documentation style.  I will soon be publishing property wrapper on PyPI for public use.

If you're an employer and would like to see the source code of projects mentioned in my resume, or additional samples demonstrating my abilities with certain languages or concepts, please contact me at grantyorkpalmer@gmail.com.

## Thank you for your interest!
